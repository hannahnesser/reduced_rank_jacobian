# Reduced-Cost Construction of Jacobian Matrices
This repository includes the demonstration code for the reduced-rank and reduced-dimension Jacobian methods described in *Reduced-cost construction of Jacobian matrices for high-resolution
inversions of satellite observations of atmospheric composition* (Atmospheric Measurement Techniques, 2021). Please contact me if you have any questions!
